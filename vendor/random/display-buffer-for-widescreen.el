;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Set `display-buffer-function' to
;; `display-buffer-function-according-to-window-width'. It determines
;; how to split window according to `window-width'. The threshold
;; value is 125 by default.
;; 

;;; Commands:
;;
;; Below are complete command list:
;;
;;
;;; Customizable Options:
;;
;; Below are customizable option list:
;;
;;  `split-window-horizontally-threshold-width'
;;    *If the current window is more than this-value columns wide, split horizontally, else split vertically.
;;    default = 125

;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put display-buffer-for-wide-screen.el to your load-path.
;; The load-path is usually ~/elisp/.
;; It's set in your ~/.emacs like this:
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;;
;; And the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;; (require 'display-buffer-for-wide-screen)
;;
;; No need more.
