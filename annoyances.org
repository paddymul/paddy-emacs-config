* emacs annoyances
** comint modes
*** one keypress for debugging (pdb)
add abbrevs for pdb mode 
pressing s means s+return
that wont't work because you couldn't type "sort"
remap keys so that C-s sends "s+return"
*** really long pathnames
replace ~/basedir with colored {{BASEDIR}}/  or something similar
replace site_packages with something similar

** compile mode
*** pdbtrack doesn't work
it does on scott's machine

** shell-mode
** 
** general text editting
*** moving groups of lines
Move active region up or down
META SHIFT P  should move region up
META SHIFT N  should move regiond down

*** navigating through text in larger jumps
make moving through text behave like a binary search 
going up and down lines to slow
make SHIFT C-n  move up two lines
next SHIFT C-N  move up 4 lines
next SHIFT C-N  move up 8 lines
next c-n  move up 8 lines
any other input

c-n move up line
SHIFT C-N move up two lines

*** make *-word commands stop at line breaks
   Make '(backword-word forward-word backward-kill-word and forward-kill-word)
stop at line endings 

*** command to insert current buffer filename into buffer
Add function to insert complete buffer path into current buffer or kill-ring
preferably kill-ring  that way 
also have an anything shortcut so that you can type maybe 
H-M f and you get an anything buffer that searches through file names
and on return inserts taht filename into the current buffer


*** copy and paste in read-only-made
when in read-only mode I can't kill text into buffer
set it up so that in read-only mode, kill is remapped to non destructive copy to kill-ring 

this works when in view mode via 
a view-mode-hook

it doesn't work when a buffer is marked read only

ideas

I probably will need to use defadvice to make this work
defadvice on kill-line kill-region  -- would prefer not to
will slow down kill-line and kill-region

would prefer defadvice on whatever function causes a buffer to go into read only mode

a defadvice or hook on buffer open won't always accomplish what I desire

*** highlight current keyword
